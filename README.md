# velision-new â€” quick setup

Quick local setup:
1. From dev container terminal:
   - cd /workspaces/velision-new
   - chmod +x ./setup.sh
   - ./setup.sh

2. Start servers:
   - Server: cd server && npm run dev
   - Client: cd client && npm start

Notes for CI/Netlify:
- Netlify expects a root package.json. This repo provides a root "build" script which runs the client's build: `npm run build`.
- Ensure Netlify's publish directory is set to `client/build`.

Environment:
- For local dev set SKIP_DB_ON_MISSING=true in server/.env to avoid 503 while DB is not configured.
- For production set a valid MONGO_URI in your host (Render/Netlify environment variables).
